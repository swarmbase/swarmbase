/**
 * Pure quorum-decision logic for the initial-load quorum protocol.
 *
 * Closes the "no quorum protocol for verifying initial document state" gap
 * tracked under issue #189 §5.4 item 2 (also a bullet under #186). The
 * design:
 *
 *   - Loader asks up to K peers in parallel for a `tipsHash` (see
 *     `tips-hash.ts`) advertising their view of the document's tip set.
 *   - Each peer either returns a hash, returns `null` (decline, e.g. unknown
 *     document or unauthorized), or fails to respond before the timeout
 *     (also represented as `null` here).
 *   - This module decides whether enough peers (>= Q) agreed on a single
 *     tip-set hash. If so, the loader proceeds with a normal single-peer
 *     document-load against any peer in the agreeing set. If not, the
 *     loader raises `LoadQuorumFailedError` and the application can decide
 *     how to recover (retry, surface to the user, etc.).
 *
 * The functions in this module are intentionally pure (no I/O, no clock,
 * no network) so the decision logic can be unit-tested in isolation and
 * audited as the trust-critical core of the gate.
