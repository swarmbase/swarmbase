  /**
   * Optional canonical hash of the responder's served tip set, used by the

   *
   * When a new node opens a document it queries up to K peers in parallel
   * via `tipAdvertiseV1`; each peer responds with a `CRDTSyncMessage` whose
   * only populated payload field is `tipsHash`. The loader counts how many
   * peers returned the same hash and proceeds with a full
   * documentLoadV3/snapshotLoadV3 against one of the agreeing peers only
   * when at least Q peers agree.
   *
   * # Protocol contract: WHAT to hash
   *
   * `tipsHash` is computed over the **served frontier** -- the heads of
   * the change tree the responder would actually ship in a load response
   * (NOT the full local DAG frontier). The reference implementation is
   * `CollabswarmDocument._servedFrontier()` in `collabswarm-document.ts`,
   * which computes this via `computeServedFrontier` over
   * `_lastSyncMessage.changes` plus `_latestSnapshot?.lastChangeNodeCID`
   * -- exactly the inputs `handleLoadRequestData` /
   * `handleSnapshotLoadRequestData` populate into the load response.
   *
   * Hashing this set produces a value the loader can reproduce
   * structurally from the served payload via `computeServedFrontier`,
   * which is exactly the binding `_sendLoadRequestAndSync` uses.
   *
   * # Implementer warning: do NOT hash `_currentFrontier()` or `_hashes`
   *
   * Implementers **MUST NOT** hash `_currentFrontier()` (the full local
   * DAG frontier). A peer that has remotely-applied heads not yet
   * cross-linked into `_lastSyncMessage.changes` produces a
   * `_currentFrontier()` larger than the served frontier, so the
   * advertised hash would not match what the load response actually
   * contains. The loader's structural bind check derives the served
   * frontier from the received `changes` tree and rejects honest peers
   * whose advertise hash disagrees. Round 8 of the PR #284 Copilot
   * review caught this exact bug.
   *
   * Implementers **MUST NOT** hash the full `_hashes` set either. Two
   * honest peers with the same logical document state can have DIFFERENT
   * observed-CID sets when their history depths differ (history
   * compaction, snapshot-loads that don't restore ancestors, different
   * join times). Round 3 of the PR #284 Copilot review caught and fixed
   * that earlier variant of the bug.
   *
   * Hashing the served frontier makes the hash deterministic across
   * honest peers whose `_lastSyncMessage` / `_latestSnapshot` describe
   * the same logical state.
   *
   * The field is also tolerated (but optional) on regular load responses,
   * so a future optimization can fold quorum into the full load. It is
   * base64-encoded for JSON-safe transport by the sync-message serializers
   * (same pattern as `welcomeEpochId`).
   *
   * Closes the gap tracked under issue #189 §5.4 item 2.

  /**
   * Explicit tip-set advertisement, populated by load responses
   * (documentLoadV3 and snapshotLoadV3) to bind the served full state to
   * the responder's served frontier. **Part of the signed payload** on v3
   * load responses -- changing the wire shape from v2 is why the protocol
   * id was bumped (see `wire-protocols.ts`).
   *
   * "Frontier" here means the **served frontier** -- the heads of the
   * change tree this load response actually carries (computed by
   * `CollabswarmDocument._servedFrontier()` via `computeServedFrontier`
   * over `_lastSyncMessage.changes` plus `_latestSnapshot?.lastChangeNodeCID`).
   * This is the set the responder attests it is shipping in THIS payload,
   * not the full set of heads the responder has in its local DAG.
   *
   * # Why served frontier (not local DAG frontier)
   *
   * A load response only carries one change tree (rooted at
   * `changeId`), plus an optional snapshot. A peer that has multiple
   * concurrent heads -- e.g. one local head plus a remotely-applied head
   * not yet cross-linked into `_lastSyncMessage.changes` -- can only
   * serve one of them in a single load response. Advertising the full
   * local DAG frontier in `tips` would not match the structurally-derived
   * frontier of the served payload, so the loader's bind check would
   * reject honest peers. Round 8 of the PR #284 Copilot review caught
   * this; advertising the served frontier closes the gap.
   *
   * # Why this field exists at all (defense-in-depth)
   *
   * The loader's PRIMARY binding (PR #284 r7) is derived structurally
   * from `message.changes` / `message.snapshot` via
   * `computeServedFrontier`, so a malicious peer that lies in `tips`
   * cannot bypass the gate by simply claiming the agreed CIDs. The
   * `tips` field is verified as a defense-in-depth attestation: if
   * present, it MUST hash to the same value as the
   * structurally-derived served frontier -- catching responders that
   * equivocate between their attested heads and the actual served
   * payload (e.g. tampered `changes` with a still-correct-looking
   * `tips` array).
   *
   * Recomputing `tipsHash(loader._hashes)` after sync is unreliable
   * because:
   *   - on a snapshot-load, only the snapshot boundary CID is added to
   *     `_hashes` -- the ancestor CIDs the snapshot compacts away are NOT
   *     restored, so `_hashes` does not represent the responder's full
   *     history;
   *   - on a regular doc-load, the loader's pre-existing local CIDs (if
   *     any) inflate `_hashes` beyond what the responder advertised;
   *   - on a compacted/pruned peer, the responder's `_hashes` includes
   *     referenced ancestors which two honest peers can have differently
   *     based on sync history -- which is exactly the bug round 3 of the
   *     Copilot review flagged.
   *
   * Because the load response is signed by the responder, `tips` is a
   * responder-signed attestation of "the heads of what I am serving";
   * a peer that voted hash X but then serves a load with a `tips` array
   * that hashes to anything other than the served-payload frontier is
   * caught by the defense-in-depth check.
   *
   * `tips` is REQUIRED on v3 load responses (responder always populates,
   * loader rejects absence when the quorum gate is enabled). The field
   * remains optional in the TypeScript type because the same
   * `CRDTSyncMessage` shape is also used for pubsub-broadcast change
   * messages, which do not carry a frontier advertisement.
