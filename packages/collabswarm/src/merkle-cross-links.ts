/**
 * Pure helper: derive the served frontier of a load-response payload
 * STRUCTURALLY, without applying any of it to local state.
 *
 * The initial-load quorum binding (#186 / #189 §5.4.2) needs to verify that
 * the full-load response a peer serves actually corresponds to the
 * tip-set hash that peer voted for in the probe round. Previously the
 * loader hashed the responder-supplied `message.tips` array and compared
 * to the quorum-agreed hash -- which trusted the responder's own
 * attestation as the source of truth. A malicious peer could vote hash
 * X, put X's tip CIDs in `message.tips`, and then serve a `changes`
 * payload describing a completely different state; the binding would
 * still pass.
 *
 * This helper closes that gap: given the served `changes` tree (rooted
 * at `changeId`) plus an optional `snapshotBoundaryCid` from
 * `message.snapshot.lastChangeNodeCID`, it computes the frontier as a
 * function of the payload's structure -- the set of CIDs that appear in
 * the served tree but are NOT referenced as a parent (child-key) of any
 * node in the same tree. Hashing this set with `tipsHash` and comparing
 * to `winningHashHex` produces a binding decision that does not depend
 * on the responder's own attestation.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   - Initialise `cids = {}` and `referenced = {}`.
 *   - If `changes` is present, walk the tree:
 *       - Record `changeId` (if defined) into `cids` (it is a node in
 *         the served tree, even if it has no children).
 *       - For every `(childId, childNode)` pair encountered in any
 *         `children` map, record `childId` into BOTH `cids` (the child
 *         is a node in the served tree) AND `referenced` (the child is
 *         a parent of the current node, so it is NOT a head).
 *       - Recurse into the child's own children (if not deferred).
 *   - If `snapshotBoundaryCid` is provided and non-empty, record it
 *     into `cids`. The snapshot boundary is a node the responder
 *     attests to (post-sync the loader adds it to `_hashes`); whether
 *     it ends up in the frontier depends on whether any post-snapshot
 *     change in `changes` references it as a parent.
 *   - Return `cids \ referenced` -- the heads (CIDs nobody points to).
 *
 * Edge cases:
 *   - Both `changes` undefined AND `snapshotBoundaryCid` empty: the
 *     responder is brand new / has no state. Returns `[]`. The loader
 *     can compare against the canonical hash of `[]` to detect a
 *     responder that voted for a non-empty state but serves nothing.
 *   - `changeId === undefined` with `changes` defined: the served tree
 *     is anonymous (no root CID). Pure helpers in this module already
 *     tolerate `nodeId === undefined`; we record nothing for the
 *     anonymous root, so an anonymous served tree contributes only its
 *     children-keys to the analysis.
 *   - Deferred children sentinel: treated identically to
 *     `collectReferencedAncestors` -- the children of a deferred node
 *     are unknown; we do not recurse. Any CIDs that appear as keys
 *     leading INTO a deferred child are still recorded as referenced
 *     (we saw them as a child-key before the deferred indicator).
 *   - Cycles: defensively guarded by a `visited` set on node CIDs.
 *
 * This is structurally identical to applying the served payload and
 * then computing `_hashes \ _referencedAncestors` on an EMPTY pre-sync
 * loader, except it works in pure form (no I/O, no Helia blockstore
 * fetch, no document state mutation). The returned array is unsorted;
 * `tipsHash` performs its own canonical sort. See PR #284 r7 Copilot
 * review for the design discussion.
