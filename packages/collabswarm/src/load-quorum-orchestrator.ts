/**
 * Orchestration helper for the initial-load quorum gate (#186 / #189 §5.4.2).
 *
 * The pure quorum decision module (`load-quorum.ts`) is responsible for
 * computing whether a set of tip-advertise responses meets the agreement
 * threshold. It is intentionally I/O-free so the trust-critical decision
 * logic can be audited and unit-tested in isolation.
 *
 * This module sits one layer up: it takes a peer list and a caller-supplied
 * probe function and orchestrates the K-of-Q probe round, returning the
 * narrowed agreeing-cohort peer list plus the winning hash (or throwing
 * `LoadQuorumFailedError` on any failure mode). It is also pure with respect
 * to libp2p/Helia -- the only network coupling lives in the `probeFn`
 * callback that `CollabswarmDocument.load()` passes in. That decoupling
 * exists so the production orchestration path can be exercised by unit tests
 * without a real libp2p/Helia stack (the codebase has no precedent for full
 * libp2p test doubles, and the load orchestration is the security gate
 * Copilot's PR #284 r4 review asked to be regression-tested).
 *
 * Callers wire this module by:
 *
 *   1. Computing the peer list (already-deduped by libp2p PeerId so a single
 *      peer with multiple open connections cannot cast multiple votes).
 *   2. Passing a `probeFn` that, given a peer, returns a `Promise<Uint8Array
 *      | null>` -- the peer's advertised `tipsHash` bytes, or `null` for any
 *      non-vote outcome (timeout, decline, decryption failure, etc.).
 *   3. Passing a `peerIdOf` extractor so this module can narrow the peer list
 *      down to the agreeing cohort without knowing about Multiaddrs.
 *
 * The return value is either:
 *   - `{ skipped: true }` — quorum disabled, or no peers (caller falls through
 *     to the legacy single-peer load loop / treats as new document).
 *   - `{ ok: true, narrowedPeers, winningHashHex }` — quorum passed; caller
 *     does the full document-load against `narrowedPeers` with the binding
 *     check pinned to `winningHashHex`.
 *
 * Failures (insufficient responses, no majority, etc.) are thrown as
 * `LoadQuorumFailedError` so the caller's existing `instanceof`-based
 * propagation works unchanged.

 * @param peerIdOf Extracts a stable peer-id key from each peer entry; used

 * @param probeFn Probes one peer for a `tipsHash`. Should return `null` for
 *   any non-vote outcome (timeout, decline, decryption failure, malformed
 *   hash, etc.). If `probeFn` throws or rejects, the orchestrator catches
 *   it at the boundary, logs the error, and records the peer as a non-vote
 *   so the surrounding `LoadQuorumFailedError` contract is preserved. Even
 *   so, a thrown probe still indicates a bug in the caller's probe
 *   implementation and should be fixed at the source.
 * @param documentPath Used to construct the `LoadQuorumFailedError` on
 *   failure; carries the document name into operator-visible logs.
 * @param config Quorum tuning knobs (see `LoadQuorumOrchestratorConfig`).
 *
 * @returns Either `{ skipped }` (gate disabled or no peers) or
