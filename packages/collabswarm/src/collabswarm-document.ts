   * Returns this peer's current frontier as a plain string[] of CIDs —
   * "what tips would I advertise to a fresh `tipAdvertiseV1` probe right
   * now".
   *
   * The frontier is the set of heads of the local merged-changes DAG:
   * CIDs that this peer has seen but that no other change references as
   * a parent or cross-link target. Computed as `_hashes \
   * _referencedAncestors`. See the `_referencedAncestors` field docstring
   * for why this matters: it is the part of the local DAG that converges
   * across honest peers regardless of differing sync histories or pruning
   * levels, so two peers in the same logical state produce identical
   * `tipsHash` digests.
   *
   * Returning the full `_hashes` set (the prior buggy implementation)
   * silently breaks the initial-load quorum gate -- it includes every
   * referenced ancestor, so two honest peers with the same heads but
   * differing ancestor visibility (e.g. one loaded from a snapshot, the
   * other has the full history) produce different tip-set hashes and
   * fail quorum even though they agree on state.
   *
   * Edge cases:
   *   - Empty DAG (founding member, brand-new document): `_hashes` is
   *     empty, the returned frontier is `[]`. `tipsHash([])` is the
   *     SHA-256 of the empty string, a deterministic value all honest
   *     peers compute identically -- quorum cleanly bootstraps.
   *   - Just-loaded from snapshot: `_hashes` holds the snapshot boundary
   *     CID (and any post-snapshot changes). The boundary CID is NOT in
   *     `_referencedAncestors` (no in-tree node points back through it),
   *     so it correctly appears as a head along with any post-snapshot
   *     leaves -- which is exactly what the responder would serve.
   *   - Pruned ancestors: irrelevant. Pruning removes CIDs from the
   *     in-memory change tree but leaves them in `_hashes` for dedup;
   *     they were already in `_referencedAncestors` (recorded when the
   *     tree contained them), so they remain marked as non-heads.
   *
   * Wrapped in a helper so the load-response handlers
   * (`handleLoadRequestData`, `handleSnapshotLoadRequestData`) and the
   * tip-advertise handler (`handleTipAdvertiseRequestData`) all hit the
   * same canonical primitive -- the probe-then-load round-trip binds
   * against a byte-identical tip set. Returns a fresh array so callers
   * can't mutate internal state; `tipsHash` sorts independently, so we
   * don't sort here.
   *

   * in a single `documentLoadV3` / `snapshotLoadV3` round.
   *
   * # Why this is NOT the same as `_currentFrontier()`
   *
   * `_currentFrontier()` returns the heads of the local DAG (`_hashes \
   * _referencedAncestors`) -- the structural truth of EVERYTHING this peer
   * has seen. That set is the right answer for "what is the logical state
   * of my local document?", but it is the WRONG answer for "what hash
   * should I advertise in a `tipAdvertiseV1` probe?".
   *
   * A load response only carries ONE change tree (rooted at
   * `_lastSyncMessage.changeId`), plus optionally `_latestSnapshot` --
   * `_lastSyncMessage` is only refreshed by `_makeChange()`, so its tree
   * is rooted at *this peer's* last locally-produced change. Remote
   * changes broadcast over GossipSub are applied to local CRDT state and
   * recorded in `_hashes`, but they do NOT become roots of
   * `_lastSyncMessage.changes` until this peer makes its next local
   * change (which cross-links them via `selectCrossLinks`).
   *
   * So when a peer has multiple concurrent heads (e.g. its own last local
   * change H1 plus remotely-applied changes H2, H3 that aren't yet
   * cross-linked from any local change), `_currentFrontier()` returns
   * `{H1, H2, H3}` but the load response only contains H1's subtree.
   * Round 8 of the PR #284 Copilot review caught the resulting
   * inconsistency: the tip-advertise probe would hash `{H1, H2, H3}` and
   * win the quorum vote, but the served payload's structural frontier
   * (`computeServedFrontier(...)` on the loader side) hashes only `{H1}`,
   * causing the loader's bind check to reject the honest peer.
   *
   * # What this returns
   *
   * The heads of the served payload, computed via `computeServedFrontier`
   * over EXACTLY the same inputs the load response will carry:
   *   - `_lastSyncMessage?.changeId` -- root CID of the served tree (if any);
   *   - `_lastSyncMessage?.changes` -- the served tree itself (if any);
   *   - `_latestSnapshot?.lastChangeNodeCID` -- snapshot boundary CID (if any).
   *
   * This mirrors the loader's `_sendLoadRequestAndSync` binding check:
   * both sides hash the structurally-derived served frontier, so an
   * honest responder advertises a hash the loader can reproduce from the
   * payload it received. Two honest peers in the same logical state with
   * the same `_lastSyncMessage` / `_latestSnapshot` advertise the same
   * hash regardless of any unrelated concurrent heads they happen to be
   * holding in `_currentFrontier()`.
   *
   * # Trade-off (acknowledged)
   *
   * The quorum no longer verifies that a responder has all of its
   * logical heads -- only the ones it would actually serve. A peer with
   * un-served concurrent heads can pass quorum on the subset it ships
   * via load. This matches the existing load semantics (the load only
   * ever ships what `_lastSyncMessage` covers anyway) and is reconciled
   * by post-load GossipSub sync; the alternative (Option B in the design
   * notes) would require the load response itself to carry every head's
   * subtree, a larger protocol change. See PR #284 r8 review.

   * Load sends a new load request to any connected peer (each peer is tried one at a time). The expected
   * response from a load request is a sync message containing all document change hashes.
   *
   * Load is used to fetch any new changes that a connecting node is missing.
   *
   * @param preferredPeer Optional peer to try first (typically a PeerId from a
   *   pubsub message sender). Matched against peers by extracting the `/p2p/<id>`
   *   substring from each peer's `Multiaddr.toString()` (the canonical string
   *   form), since `@multiformats/multiaddr` v13 dropped the `getPeerId()`
   *   helper and `getComponents()` may surface the `/p2p` value as bytes.
   * **Initial-load quorum gate.** When
   * `CollabswarmConfig.loadQuorumEnabled` is `true` (the default), `load()`
   * first queries up to `loadQuorumK` peers in parallel via the
   * `tipAdvertiseV1` protocol for a lightweight tip-set hash. The full
   * document-load only proceeds against a peer that participated in a
   * majority (`loadQuorumQ`-of-K) agreement on the tip set, defending
   * against a single malicious or partitioned peer unilaterally serving a
   * stale or maliciously-crafted initial state. The gate runs uniformly
   * regardless of local `_hashes` state (an empty local `_hashes` is the
   * exact state the gate must defend on first `open()` of an existing
   * document — bypassing it then would be unsafe). If quorum is not met,
   * `load()` rejects with a `LoadQuorumFailedError` (see
   * `load-quorum.ts`). The gate can be disabled wholesale via
   * `loadQuorumEnabled: false` for single-peer dev/test scenarios; the
   * single-peer edge case is covered by `loadQuorumAllowSinglePeer`. Tip-
   * advertise responses with an unknown encryption key, missing/invalid
   * writer signature, document-id mismatch, or short/missing tip hash are
   * recorded as non-votes (NOT disagreements) so a stale peer cache does
   * not flip a partition into a Byzantine-failure verdict. The probe
   * round dedupes peers by libp2p PeerId so a single peer with multiple
   * open connections cannot cast multiple votes. The legacy load loop
   * (when `loadQuorumEnabled: false`) keeps the ORIGINAL un-deduped
   * peer list so it can retry across multiple multiaddrs for the same
   * peer id (e.g. a direct connection + a relay-circuit fallback). See
   * PR #284 r7 Copilot review for the dedup-scope rationale.
   *
   * After quorum passes, the served full state is bound to the agreed
   * hash STRUCTURALLY -- the loader derives the responder's served
   * frontier from the actual `changes`/`snapshot` payload via
   * `computeServedFrontier`, hashes that, and verifies it equals
   * `winningHashHex` BEFORE applying the response. The
   * responder-supplied `message.tips` array is NO LONGER trusted as the
   * source of truth (previous rounds did, which let a Byzantine peer
   * vote hash X, put X's tips in `message.tips`, and serve a divergent
   * payload). When present, `message.tips` is additionally checked to
   * hash to the same value as the structurally-derived served
   * frontier; this catches the responder-internal-equivocation case
   * where the served `changes` and the advertised `tips` were
   * assembled inconsistently. See PR #284 r7 Copilot review. An
   * agreeing peer whose served payload's structural frontier hashes to
   * something other than `winningHashHex` is treated as a PER-PEER bind
   * failure: the loader records the offending peer in
   * `agreeingPeerBindFailures`, skips it, and tries the next peer in
   * the agreeing cohort. This prevents a single malicious peer in the
   * agreeing cohort from DoS'ing the entire load by voting for the
   * majority hash (passing quorum) and then serving a mismatched full
   * load. Only after EVERY peer in the agreeing cohort has bind-failed
   * does the loader throw `LoadQuorumFailedError(reason: 'bind-check-
   * failed-all-agreeing-peers')`, with `agreeingPeerBindFailures`
   * recording per-peer what each Byzantine peer served instead.
   * Closes the gap tracked under issue #189 §5.4 item 2 (and bulleted
   * in #186). See PR #284 r6 Copilot review for the DoS rationale on
   * the per-peer retry.
   *
   * @returns `true` if the document was successfully loaded from a peer.
   *   `false` if no peer could provide the document -- this is ambiguous: it
   *   may mean the document is brand new (no peers have it) OR that all peers
   *   failed to respond, failed to decrypt, or failed signature verification.
   *   Note: `open()` treats `false` as "new document" and initializes a fresh
   *   document with the current user as writer and a new encryption key.
   * @throws {LoadQuorumFailedError} When the initial-load quorum gate is
   *   enabled and fewer than `loadQuorumQ` peers agreed on the same tip
   *   hash within the configured timeout. Callers can `instanceof`-check
   *   this error to distinguish quorum failure from other I/O errors
   *   raised inside `load()`. The original single-peer

   * Opens this collabswarm document. The sequence of operations is:

   * 1. Call `.load()` to fetch the document from an existing peer via direct dial.
   * 2. If the document is new (load returned false), run `validateDocumentPath`
   *    (if configured) to ensure the path is allowed before proceeding.
   * 3. Assign the pubsub message handler, subscribe to the document's GossipSub
   *    pubsub topic, and register protocol handlers for load, key-update, and
   *    snapshot-load requests.
   * 4. If `enableTopicValidators` is set, register a GossipSub topic validator
   *    that rejects messages that fail signature verification.
   * 5. For new documents, add the current user as a writer and generate an
   *    initial document encryption key.
   *
   * Once opened, a document can be closed with `.close()`.
   *
   * **Design note:** `load()` runs before protocol handlers are registered, so
   * this node cannot serve incoming load/key-update requests for *this* document
   * during the load window. This is intentional -- validation must complete before
   * subscribing to pubsub to prevent briefly joining an unauthorized topic, and
   * the document is not yet fully open so it has nothing to serve.
   *
   * **Race window:** Messages published by peers between the `load()` response
   * and the `pubsub.subscribe()` call will be missed. This is a deliberate
   * trade-off: validation must complete before subscribing to prevent briefly
   * joining an unauthorized topic. The window is mitigated by the fact that
   * subsequent messages will arrive once subscribed, and the underlying CRDT
   * guarantees eventual consistency. Callers who need to ensure no messages
   * were missed should call `load()` again after `open()` resolves to re-sync
   * the latest state from a peer.
   *
   * @returns `false` if `load()` returned `false` -- which `open()` treats as
   *   "new document" by adding the current user as a writer and generating an
   *   initial encryption key. Note that `load()` returning `false` is ambiguous:
   *   it may also mean all peers failed (see `load()` docs for details).
   * @throws {Error} If `validateDocumentPath` is configured and rejects the path
   *   for a new document. Validation runs before subscribing to pubsub or
   *   registering protocol handlers, so no cleanup is needed on rejection.

   * remote changes will be re-applied on the next sync cycle or document
   * load. If transaction failure is critical, callers should re-sync the
   * document after a failed transaction (e.g. call `load()` or wait for
   * the next pubsub round) to ensure remote state is promptly restored.
   *
   * **Known limitation -- partial internal state on failure:** If
   * `_makeChange()` fails partway through (e.g. encryption succeeds but
   * pubsub publish throws), `_hashes` may retain CIDs for the rolled-back
   * change (see below). Other counters and bookkeeping fields
   * (`_lastSyncMessage`, `_documentChangeCount`, `_changesSinceSnapshot`,
   * `_recentTips`) ARE restored from snapshots captured before
   * `_makeChange()` -- see the "Internal metadata rollback" section below
   * for details.
   *
   * **Specifically, `_hashes` may retain CIDs for the rolled-back change.**
   * Because `_hashes` is used to skip already-seen changes during sync,
   * any CID added before the failure will cause that change to be silently
   * skipped if it arrives again via pubsub or `load()`. This means the
   * rolled-back change is effectively "lost" from this peer's perspective
   * until `_hashes` is rebuilt. **Callers should call `load()` after a
   * failed transaction** to re-sync the full document state from a peer
   * and restore consistency. A new transaction must be started after a
   * failure.
   *
   * **Internal metadata rollback:** On failure, `_lastSyncMessage`,
   * `_documentChangeCount`, `_changesSinceSnapshot`, and `_recentTips`
   * are restored from snapshots captured before `_makeChange()`.
   * (`_recentTips` is bounded to `MAX_RECENT_TIPS` entries so the snapshot
   * is a cheap shallow array copy.) For `_hashes` and
   * `_referencedAncestors`, all entries added to each Set after its
   * pre-attempt size are removed. Because the node remains
   * subscribed to pubsub during the async transaction, this may include
   * CIDs appended by concurrent remote syncs, not just local ones.
   * This is acceptable because CRDT convergence guarantees those remote
   * CIDs will be re-added on the next sync cycle or document load.
   * The approach is O(n) iteration but O(delta) memory -- no full
   * array clone -- and avoids disrupting any concurrent sync iteration
   * that `clear()` would break. A new transaction must be started after
   * a failure.
   *
   * @throws {Error} If any step in the commit pipeline fails.

  /**
   * Build and send a BeeKEM Welcome message to a newly-added reader.
   *
   * The Welcome payload is a `CRDTSyncMessage` carrying:
   * - `welcomeEpochId`: the current keychain key ID, which the recipient
   *   records as their `_invitationEpoch` for later `since_invited` history
   *   filtering.
   * - `welcomeRecipient`: serialized public key of the intended recipient.
   *   The inviter cannot identify which connected peer is the new reader,
   *   so Welcomes are broadcast to every peer; the recipient binding
   *   ensures a *well-behaved* non-target peer drops the Welcome rather
   *   than installing the document key. The binding is covered by the
   *   writer signature, so a non-writer cannot redirect a Welcome to a
   *   different recipient.
   * - `welcomeRecipientKemPublicKey`: raw SEC1 P-256 ECDH public key of
   *   the recipient. Also covered by the writer signature -- the writer
   *   commits to a specific encryption key for a specific identity, so
   *   an attacker that owns one of those two values alone cannot
   *   redirect the sealed payload.
   * - `eciesSealed`: the inviter-side serialized keychain delta
   *   encrypted under the recipient's ECDH key via ECIES (see
   *   `ecies.ts`). This is the confidentiality control: a
   *   non-recipient peer that receives the broadcast cannot decrypt
   *   the keychain delta. The keychain plaintext is filtered per the
   *   document's `historyVisibility` **from the recipient's
   *   perspective** (see `_keychainChangesForWelcome()`).
   * - `signature`: writer signature over the message so the receiver can
   *   confirm a legitimate writer is the inviter (and ignore forgeries).
   *   Crucially, the signature covers the **sealed** bytes, not the
   *   plaintext, so a replayed or tampered sealed payload fails
   *   signature verification.
   *
   * Confidentiality: the keychain delta is end-to-end encrypted to the
   * recipient at the application layer. libp2p's Noise/TLS transport
   * still protects on-wire bytes against off-path observers, but the
   * application-layer ECIES seal is the primary confidentiality
   * guarantee against on-path connected peers.
   *
   * Wire format (mirrors `documentKeyUpdateV2`):
   *   [4-byte BE doc-path length] [UTF-8 doc-path] [serialized sync message]

    // The threat model: a writer could (maliciously or via reordering)
    // send a later writer-signed Welcome that nominally addresses this
    // node but carries an *earlier* `welcomeEpochId`. If we
    // unconditionally overwrote `_invitationEpoch`, this would shrink
    // the recipient's join boundary, broadening the set of keys
    // returned by future `since_invited` history responses we send
    // (leaking more history than the original invitation granted).
    //
    // Comparison strategy: `_keychain.keys()` returns entries in the
    // insertion order used by Yjs/Automerge keychain implementations
    // (`keychain.keys.push(...)`). Position in that array is the
    // canonical "later means later" relation -- the same one
    // `historySince` relies on to slice the suffix. We compare the
    // positions of the existing and incoming epoch IDs; if the new
    // one is strictly later we advance, otherwise we keep the
    // existing anchor.
    //
    // Fallback: if either ID is not present in `keys()` after the
    // merge above (e.g. the merge dropped the entry, or the local
    // keychain implementation does not expose insertion order), we
    // conservatively keep the existing `_invitationEpoch` -- it is
    // already known-good. The only path that loses fidelity is the
    // first-Welcome-ever case (no existing anchor) which is handled

   * ## Atomicity contract
   *
   * Pre-validates all preconditions before mutating BeeKEM state. The
   * BeeKEM `removeMember` call is the atomicity boundary:
   *
   *   - BEFORE the BeeKEM mutation: every check that can fail
   *     synchronously / cheaply (writer authorization, ACL membership,
   *     tree initialization, leaf lookup) runs first. If any of these
   *     throws, no state has been mutated and the caller can retry
   *     without leaking a half-applied revocation.
   *   - AT the BeeKEM mutation: `BeeKEM.removeMember(leafIndex)` blanks
   *     the leaf and re-derives the writer's path key material. This
   *     advances local BeeKEM state. The CRDT-mutating ACL build step
   *     (`_readers.remove(reader)` -- not just a "compute change",
   *     both the Yjs and Automerge providers mutate their internal
   *     doc state in `remove`) and the PathUpdate signing step (which
   *     requires the new 32-byte epoch ID derived from the new root
   *     secret) cannot be hoisted ABOVE the BeeKEM mutation: building
   *     the ACL change without applying it is not part of the ACL
   *     interface, and the PathUpdate signature includes the new
   *     epoch ID by construction.
   *   - AFTER the BeeKEM mutation succeeds, every subsequent step is
   *     attempted on a BEST-EFFORT basis: broadcast and ACL-commit
   *     failures are logged but do not unwind the BeeKEM advance. The
   *     writer is always left in a consistent state -- BeeKEM advanced,
   *     local keychain updated with the new epoch key, outgoing traffic
   *     encrypted under the new key. Surviving readers may need to
   *     re-sync via a fresh document load if the ACL change or
   *     PathUpdate broadcast was dropped.
   *
   * ## Ordering on the wire
   *
   * The ACL-change broadcast must be encryptable by surviving readers
   * using a key they ALREADY have, not the post-rotation key (which
   * they only learn about once they process the PathUpdate). The
   * ACL-change pubsub message and the PathUpdate unicast stream are
   * delivered independently and can arrive in any order; each must be
   * independently decryptable to keep the receive path order-
   * insensitive. This is why `addEpochKey` (which flips
   * `_keychain.current()` to the new key) is deferred until AFTER
   * both broadcasts: while `_makeChange` runs, `_keychain.current()`
   * still returns the **previous** key, which surviving readers can
   * still decrypt with.
   *
   * ## Steps
   *
   *   1. Verify the caller is a writer and look up the BeeKEM leaf
   *      assigned to the removed reader. A missing leaf is a hard
   *      error (see `@throws` below). Both ECDH-keypair and leaf-
   *      lookup preconditions are checked here, BEFORE step 2.
   *   2. Blank the leaf and re-key our path via
   *      `BeeKEM.removeMember(leafIndex)`, which returns the
   *      `PathUpdate` to broadcast and the new root secret. We do
   *      NOT run a follow-up `BeeKEM.update()`: `removeMember`
   *      already generates fresh key material along the entire path,
   *      and re-rotating immediately would discard that material in
   *      favour of yet-another rotation, doubling the work without
   *      improving the cryptographic property. **This is the atomicity
   *      boundary: every subsequent step is best-effort.**
   *   3. Derive the new document key + 32-byte epoch ID from the root
   *      secret via HKDF (see `derive-doc-key.ts`). **Hold locally;
   *      the keychain is NOT updated yet.**
   *   4. Commit the ACL removal and broadcast it via `_makeChange`,
   *      still encrypted under the **previous** keychain key (so
   *      surviving readers can decrypt regardless of PathUpdate
   *      arrival order). On failure: log a warning and fall through;
   *      surviving readers can recover the new ACL via a fresh
   *      document load.
   *   5. Broadcast the signed `PathUpdate` over `beekemPathUpdateV1`
   *      to every connected peer. Surviving readers feed it into
   *      `BeeKEM.processPathUpdate` and re-derive the same document
   *      key + epoch ID. On failure: log a warning and fall through;
   *      surviving readers can recover via a fresh document load.
   *      The local keychain install in step 6 still runs so the
   *      WRITER transitions to the new key.
   *   6. Install the new key into the LOCAL keychain. From this
   *      point on every subsequent outgoing message is encrypted
   *      under the new key. This step ALWAYS runs (even if steps
   *      4 or 5 logged failures) so the writer never gets stuck
   *      encrypting under the previous key while the BeeKEM tree
   *      has advanced.
   *
   * The revoked reader can still decrypt the step-4 ACL change (they
   * have the previous key) -- which is fine: they just learn they've
   * been removed. They CANNOT derive the new key from the step-5
   * PathUpdate because their leaf is blanked, so all future writer-
   * originated traffic remains opaque to them.
   *
   * If step 6 itself fails (local IO / WebCrypto error) the writer is
   * in a partially-rotated state -- BeeKEM has advanced but the local
   * keychain still holds only the previous key. The call throws so the
   * caller can recover (the simplest recovery is to re-open the
   * document, which re-loads keychain state). `addEpochKey` is a
   * local-only call in both shipped keychain providers (no pubsub
   * side-effects, no remote IO), so this branch is rare in practice.
   *
   * Unlike the previous "encrypt the new key under the old key" scheme,
   * the removed reader cannot derive the new key even if they were
   * connected at the moment of revocation: their leaf is blanked and
   * the new path key material is encrypted to subtrees they no longer
   * occupy. This closes the revocation-latency gap (#189 §5.4 item 5).
   *
   * @param reader User's public key.
   * @throws If the BeeKEM tree has no record of this reader (e.g.
   *   `addReader` did not seed a leaf for them, or BeeKEM membership
   *   was lost). Callers must surface this rather than silently
   *   degrading: a removeReader that "succeeded" without rotating the
   *   key would leave the removed reader with full ongoing access.
   * @throws If the local keychain install fails (step 6). Steps 1-3
   *   (pre-validation + BeeKEM rotation + key derivation) throwing
   *   leaves the ACL unchanged so the caller can retry; broadcast
   *   failures in steps 4-5 do NOT throw (they log warnings).
