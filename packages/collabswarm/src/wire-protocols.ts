// BeeKEM Welcome v1: onboards a new reader into a document. The inviting
// writer sends a Welcome containing (a) the invitation epoch ID the
// recipient should record so subsequent `since_invited` history filtering
// works, and (b) the keychain changes filtered per the document's
// `HistoryVisibility` setting -- so the new reader can decrypt (at least)
// the current document state. The payload uses the same shared
// length-prefixed-document-path header as the V2 key-update protocol so
// the shared handler can route incoming Welcomes to the correct document.
//
// =============================================================================
// CONFIDENTIALITY: payload sealed to the recipient (ECIES, P-256 ECDH +
// HKDF-SHA-256 + AES-256-GCM)
// =============================================================================
// The Welcome's keychain delta is **not** broadcast in the clear. The
// `CRDTSyncMessage` carrying a Welcome has a dedicated `eciesSealed` field
// (see `crdt-sync-message.ts` / `ecies.ts`) which is the ECIES sealed-box
// over the serialized keychain changes, encrypted under the recipient's
// ECDH public key (`welcomeRecipientKemPublicKey`). Only the recipient
// holding the matching ECDH private key can recover the plaintext keychain
// delta -- a non-recipient peer that is connected at broadcast time sees
// only the opaque ciphertext + ephemeral public key + nonce + tag.
//
// The writer signature covers the sealed bytes (not the plaintext), so a
// connected peer cannot alter the sealed payload without invalidating the
// signature. The recipient binding (`welcomeRecipient`, also covered by
// the signature) prevents an authorized writer from re-pointing a sealed
// payload at a different identity than the one the encryption keypair
// belongs to.
//
// Defense-in-depth retained from earlier versions of this protocol:
//   - `welcomeRecipient` continues to gate processing: a well-behaved
//     non-target peer drops the Welcome rather than attempting to install
//     the keychain delta. Confidentiality is enforced by ECIES; the
//     recipient binding is the authorization gate.
//   - libp2p's Noise/TLS transport still protects on-wire bytes from
//     off-path observers, on top of the application-layer encryption.
//
// =============================================================================
// Race mitigation on the receive side
// =============================================================================
// The inviter sends the readers-ACL update over pubsub and the Welcome over
// a direct stream; without coordination these can arrive out of order on the
// recipient. The Welcome itself is fire-and-forget: there is NO ack protocol
// in this version, and the inviter does NOT retry. Instead, the recipient's
// `CollabswarmDocument._evaluateAndApplyBeeKEMWelcome` buffers Welcomes
// dropped solely because the local user is not yet in the readers ACL into a
// small bounded `pendingWelcomes` Map (max 16 entries, ~5 min TTL) keyed by
// `hex(welcomeEpochId)`. The buffer is drained on every readers-ACL merge,
// so a Welcome that arrived before its corresponding ACL update gets
// replayed automatically. A Welcome that exhausts the TTL without an
// unblocking ACL update is discarded; the recipient must then rely on a
// fresh document-load against an authorized peer to recover keychain state.
//
// Note: only the reader-onboarding path is wired in this PR
// (`CollabswarmDocument.addReader`). A writer-onboarding flow that
// piggy-backs on the same wire format is a future extension; until that
// is wired up the protocol is documented as a reader-only flow.

// BeeKEM PathUpdate v1: distributes a BeeKEM ratchet-tree path update to
// every surviving member of a document. Used by
// `CollabswarmDocument.removeReader` to revoke a reader: the writer
// blanks the removed leaf, re-keys the path with `BeeKEM.update`, and
// broadcasts the resulting `PathUpdate`. Each remaining reader applies it
// with `BeeKEM.processPathUpdate` and re-derives the document key from
// the fresh root secret (see `derive-doc-key.ts`). The removed reader
// cannot derive the new key — their leaf is blanked and the new path key
// material is encrypted to subtrees they no longer occupy — which closes
// the revocation-latency gap of the previous "encrypt new key under old
// key" rotation scheme.
//
// =============================================================================
// SAFETY-CRITICAL: writer-only
// =============================================================================
// The PathUpdate body is **writer-signed unconditionally**, mirroring the
// BeeKEM Welcome v1 protocol: peer-reachable signing keys are checked
// regardless of the `enableSigning` document toggle. A malicious peer that
// could forge a PathUpdate would force every surviving reader to switch
// to an attacker-controlled BeeKEM state, making all subsequent
// document traffic readable to the attacker. Receivers MUST drop any
// PathUpdate whose signature is missing or invalid.
//
// =============================================================================
// Wire format (mirrors `documentKeyUpdateV2` / `beekemWelcomeV1` framing)
// =============================================================================
//   [4-byte BE doc-path length] [UTF-8 doc-path] [serialized sync message]
//
// The sync message carries:
//   - `pathUpdate`: the `PathUpdate` produced by
//     `BeeKEM.removeMember(leafIdx)` + `BeeKEM.update()`, serialized via
//     the `SerializedPathUpdate` wire shape (see `path-update-wire.ts`).
//   - `pathUpdateEpochId`: the FULL 32-byte HKDF-derived epoch
//     identifier (output of `deriveEpochIdFromRootSecret`). Receivers
//     compare the full 32 bytes against their locally-derived ID; only
//     after the full-length match do they truncate to the keychain
//     provider's narrower key-ID width (`keyIDLength`, currently 16)
//     for the local install. Sending the full 32 bytes avoids silent
//     collisions where a sender and receiver agree on the truncated
//     prefix but diverge on the un-truncated root, which would let a
//     bogus PathUpdate slip through the epoch-ID gate.
//   - `signature`: writer signature over the canonical
//     (signature-stripped) serialization of the sync message.
//
// =============================================================================
// Confidentiality
// =============================================================================
// PathUpdates carry only public-key material plus key updates encrypted
// to specific subtree resolution keys — no plaintext document secrets —
// so on-wire encryption (Noise/TLS via libp2p) is sufficient. The
// security guarantee comes from BeeKEM itself: only members on the
// non-blanked side of each path-update step can decrypt the corresponding
// encrypted-private-key field. A revoked reader who observes the
// PathUpdate cannot recover the root secret.
//
// =============================================================================
// Failure modes
// =============================================================================
// If some surviving reader fails to receive the PathUpdate (peer
// disconnected, dial failed, etc.) they will be unable to decrypt
// document traffic encrypted under the new epoch key. A subsequent
// fresh document-load against an authorized peer recovers keychain state
// (the new epoch key is added via `Keychain.addEpochKey`, which is part
// of the keychain CRDT). The library logs each failed dial but does not
// attempt retries — `removeReader` is fire-and-forget, matching the
// best-effort posture of the existing key-update flow.
