Consider adding a way to incentivize collaborative pinning by the entire network to get better DB resiliancy.

Requires:
- A way to prove that enough pinning participation has occurred (proof of pinning for amount of time/continuously?)
- A way to be paid for pinning?
- Read or write calls need to be gated upon payment of participation tokens?

Main takeaway: Participation tokens are a potentially useful idea for gating participation unless workloads are very widely distributed across read/write heavy
