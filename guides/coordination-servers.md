# SwarmDB Coordination Server Guide

This document describes the server infrastructure required to run SwarmDB in production. SwarmDB is a peer-to-peer system, but browsers cannot directly connect to each other without coordination servers to bootstrap the network.

## 1. Server Types Overview

SwarmDB uses [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) for networking. The following server types facilitate peer-to-peer connectivity, especially for browser-based peers.

### 1.1 Bootstrap / Signaling Node

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Initial peer discovery. When a SwarmDB client starts, it dials the bootstrap node to join the network and discover other peers. |
| **When needed** | Always. At least one bootstrap node must be reachable for a new peer to join the swarm. |
| **Required?** | **Yes** (minimum 1) |
| **Protocol** | WebSocket (`/ip4/<IP>/tcp/<PORT>/ws`) or WebSocket Secure (`/ip4/<IP>/tcp/<PORT>/wss`) |
| **Ports** | TCP 9001 (WebSocket), TCP 9002 (TCP for node-to-node) |

In SwarmDB, the bootstrap node and relay node are combined into a single process (`relay-server/`). The relay server listens on WebSocket (port 9001) and TCP (port 9002), runs the libp2p identify protocol, and participates in GossipSub peer discovery via the `swarmdb._peer-discovery._p2p._pubsub` topic.

**How it works:**
1. Browser client is configured with the relay's multiaddress (e.g., `/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/9001/ws/p2p/<PEER_ID>`)
2. Client dials the relay via WebSocket
3. libp2p `identify` protocol exchanges peer information
4. `pubsub-peer-discovery` advertises the new peer to all connected peers
5. GossipSub mesh forms, enabling document synchronization

### 1.2 Circuit Relay Node

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | NAT traversal for browsers that cannot establish direct WebRTC connections. The relay forwards data between two peers that cannot reach each other directly. |
| **When needed** | Whenever browser peers are behind restrictive NATs (symmetric NAT, corporate firewalls). This is the common case on the open internet. |
| **Required?** | **Recommended** (effectively required for reliable browser-to-browser) |
| **Protocol** | Circuit Relay V2 (`@libp2p/circuit-relay-v2`) |
| **Ports** | Same as bootstrap node (combined process) |

In SwarmDB's architecture, the relay server runs `circuitRelayServer()` which implements libp2p Circuit Relay V2. Browser clients configure `circuitRelayTransport()` to connect through the relay.

**Data flow through relay:**
```text
Browser A ──WebSocket──> Relay Server ──WebSocket──> Browser B
                  (Circuit Relay V2)
```

After the relayed connection is established, libp2p may upgrade to a direct WebRTC connection if both peers' NATs allow it (ICE hole-punching). If direct connection succeeds, the relay is no longer in the data path.

### 1.3 STUN Server

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | WebRTC ICE candidate gathering. STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) allows browsers to discover their public IP address and port mapping, which is needed to establish direct WebRTC connections. |
| **When needed** | Whenever WebRTC is used (browser-to-browser). |
| **Required?** | **Yes** for WebRTC, but public STUN servers can be used |
| **Protocol** | STUN (RFC 5389) |
| **Ports** | UDP 3478 (standard STUN port) |

SwarmDB's browser clients use `@libp2p/webrtc` which relies on the browser's built-in WebRTC stack. The browser's RTCPeerConnection uses STUN servers configured at the system/browser level, or defaults to public servers. You do not typically need to run your own STUN server.

### 1.4 TURN Server

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Relays media/data when STUN-based hole-punching fails (symmetric NAT on both sides). TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) is a fallback relay at the WebRTC layer. |
| **When needed** | When peers are behind symmetric NATs where STUN cannot establish a direct path. |
| **Required?** | **Optional** (Circuit Relay V2 serves a similar purpose at the libp2p layer) |
| **Ports** | UDP/TCP 3478 |

In practice, SwarmDB's Circuit Relay V2 provides relay functionality at the libp2p protocol layer, making a separate TURN server less critical. However, adding TURN support improves connection success rates in networks with aggressive firewalls.

If you need TURN, consider [coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) (open source) or hosted services like Twilio or Xirsys.

### 1.5 Pinning Service

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Persistent storage for IPFS/Helia content. When all peers go offline, pinned content remains available. Without pinning, document data exists only while at least one peer with that data is online. |
| **When needed** | When data persistence is required beyond peer availability. |
| **Required?** | **Optional** but strongly recommended for production |
| **Protocol** | IPFS Bitswap (built into Helia) |

SwarmDB's `CollabswarmNode` (the server-side node) includes automatic pinning logic: it subscribes to the `/documents` pubsub topic and pins all received CIDs using `helia.pins.add()`.

For self-hosted pinning, run a `CollabswarmNode` instance with sufficient storage. For managed pinning, see [Public Alternatives](#4-public-alternatives).

### 1.6 DHT Bootstrap Node

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Kademlia DHT for large-scale peer discovery. The DHT enables peers to find each other without relying solely on pubsub-based discovery. |
| **When needed** | At scale (hundreds+ of peers) where pubsub discovery alone is insufficient. |
| **Required?** | **No** (SwarmDB clients run DHT in `clientMode: true` by default) |

SwarmDB clients configure `kadDHT({ clientMode: true })` which means they query the DHT but do not serve DHT requests. For large deployments, running dedicated DHT server nodes improves peer discovery reliability.

### Summary Table

| Server | Required? | Default Port(s) | Self-Hosted? | Public Available? |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Bootstrap/Relay | Yes | 9001 (WS), 9002 (TCP) | Yes (`relay-server/`) | No |
| STUN | Yes (WebRTC) | 3478 (UDP) | Optional | Yes (Google, etc.) |
| TURN | Optional | 3478 (UDP/TCP) | coturn | Yes (Twilio, Xirsys) |
| Pinning | Recommended | N/A (Bitswap) | Yes (`CollabswarmNode`) | Yes (Pinata, web3.storage) |
| DHT Bootstrap | At scale | Same as relay | Yes | No |

## 2. Minimal Single-Server Setup

This section describes running everything needed for SwarmDB on a single machine.

### 2.1 What You Need

At minimum, you need **one relay/bootstrap server** and access to **public STUN servers**. This is sufficient for development and small deployments (up to ~50 concurrent peers).

### 2.2 Architecture

```text
                    ┌─────────────────────┐

         ┌────┴────┐    ┌────┴────┐    ┌────┴────┐
         │Browser A│    │Browser B│    │Browser C│
         └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘

         (All browsers use public STUN for WebRTC)
```

### 2.3 Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# From the repository root
docker compose -f guides/docker/docker-compose.single.yaml up -d
```

Or build and run the relay server directly:

```bash
cd relay-server
yarn install
yarn build
node dist/index.js
```

The relay server will:
1. Listen on port 9001 (WebSocket) and 9002 (TCP)
2. Generate a peer ID on startup
3. Write connection info to `relay-info.json`
4. Subscribe to peer discovery and document sync topics

### 2.4 Connecting Clients

After the relay starts, configure your SwarmDB client with the relay's multiaddress:

```typescript
import { defaultNodeConfig } from '@collabswarm/collabswarm';

// The relay's multiaddress is printed on startup and written to relay-info.json
const relayMultiaddr = '/ip4/<YOUR_SERVER_IP>/tcp/9001/ws/p2p/<RELAY_PEER_ID>';

const config = defaultNodeConfig({
  list: [relayMultiaddr],
});
```

For browser apps, you can also serve the relay info as a config file:

```json
{
  "relayMultiaddr": "/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/9001/ws/p2p/12D3KooW..."
}
```

### 2.5 Port Requirements

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | Required? |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| 9001 | TCP (WebSocket) | Browser-to-relay communication | Yes |
| 9002 | TCP | Node-to-node communication | Only if node peers connect |

### 2.6 DNS and TLS

**For development:** Plain WebSocket (`ws://`) works on localhost or private networks.

**For production:** Browsers require Secure WebSocket (`wss://`) for connections to non-localhost addresses. You need:

1. A domain name pointing to your server
2. A TLS certificate (Let's Encrypt is free and automated)
3. A reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, or Traefik) that terminates TLS and proxies to port 9001

Example nginx configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name relay.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/relay.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/relay.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
        proxy_send_timeout 86400s;
    }
}
```

With TLS, clients connect using:
```text
/dns4/relay.yourdomain.com/tcp/443/wss/p2p/<RELAY_PEER_ID>
```

### 2.7 Environment Variables

The relay server currently reads no environment variables. Configuration is done at the source level. Future releases will support:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `WS_PORT` | WebSocket listen port | `9001` |
| `TCP_PORT` | TCP listen port | `9002` |
| `RELAY_INFO_PATH` | Where to write relay-info.json | `/shared/relay-info.json` or `./relay-info.json` |

---

## 3. Production Multi-Server Deployment

### 3.1 Architecture

For production with 100+ peers, deploy multiple relay nodes behind a load balancer.

```

### 3.2 Recommended Topology by Scale

#### Small (10-50 peers)
- 1 relay/bootstrap server
- Public STUN servers
- Optional: 1 pinning node

#### Medium (50-500 peers)
- 2-3 relay/bootstrap servers in different regions
- Each relay connects to the others via TCP (port 9002)
- Multiple bootstrap addresses in client config
- 1 pinning node
- Consider adding a TURN server (coturn)

#### Large (500-1000+ peers)
- 3-5 relay/bootstrap servers, geographically distributed
- Relay nodes form a full mesh via TCP
- DNS-based load balancing or anycast
- Multiple pinning nodes
- Dedicated DHT bootstrap nodes (set `clientMode: false`)
- TURN server cluster
- Monitoring and alerting

### 3.3 Multi-Relay Client Configuration

When multiple relay nodes are available, configure clients with all bootstrap addresses:

```typescript
const config = defaultNodeConfig({
  list: [
    '/dns4/relay1.yourdomain.com/tcp/443/wss/p2p/<PEER_ID_1>',
    '/dns4/relay2.yourdomain.com/tcp/443/wss/p2p/<PEER_ID_2>',
    '/dns4/relay3.yourdomain.com/tcp/443/wss/p2p/<PEER_ID_3>',
  ],
});
```

The client will attempt to connect to all bootstrap nodes. Once connected to any one, pubsub peer discovery will find the rest of the network.

### 3.4 Relay Node Inter-Connection

Relay nodes should connect to each other so GossipSub messages propagate across the entire network. Configure each relay to bootstrap from the others:

```typescript
// In relay-server/src/index.ts, add bootstrap for peer relays
peerDiscovery: [
  bootstrap({
    list: [
      '/ip4/<RELAY_2_IP>/tcp/9002/p2p/<RELAY_2_PEER_ID>',
      '/ip4/<RELAY_3_IP>/tcp/9002/p2p/<RELAY_3_PEER_ID>',
    ],
  }),
  pubsubPeerDiscovery({
    topics: [PUBSUB_PEER_DISCOVERY_TOPIC],
  }),
],
```

### 3.5 Load Balancing

**WebSocket connections are long-lived.** Standard HTTP round-robin load balancing does not apply well. Guidelines:

- A **TLS-terminating reverse proxy** (nginx, Caddy, Traefik) in front of a single relay is fine and required for `wss://` in production (see Section 2.2). This is Layer 7 but passes WebSocket frames transparently via `Upgrade` headers.
- Do **not** use an HTTP load balancer that terminates one WebSocket and opens a new upstream WebSocket (connection-splitting proxy), as this breaks libp2p's connection state and multiplexed streams.
- For **multiple relay nodes**, use DNS round-robin or give clients all relay addresses and let libp2p handle connection management. If using a load balancer across multiple backends, configure it for TCP/Layer 4 passthrough or sticky sessions so each WebSocket stays on a single backend.

### 3.6 Monitoring and Health Checks

The relay server Dockerfile includes a health check that verifies the WebSocket port is accepting connections:

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=3s --timeout=3s --retries=20 --start-period=5s \
  CMD node -e "const net = require('net'); \
    const s = net.createConnection(9001, '127.0.0.1', () => { s.end(); process.exit(0); }); \
    s.on('error', () => process.exit(1));"
```

**Metrics to monitor:**
- Number of connected peers (`libp2p.getPeers().length`)
- Number of active relay reservations
- GossipSub mesh size per topic
- Memory usage (grows with number of connections)
- Bandwidth usage (grows with message volume)

### 3.7 Resource Requirements

| Scale | CPU | RAM | Bandwidth | Storage |
|-------|-----|-----|-----------|---------|
| Small (10-50 peers) | 1 vCPU | 512 MB | 10 Mbps | 1 GB |
| Medium (50-500 peers) | 2 vCPU | 1-2 GB | 100 Mbps | 10 GB |
| Large (500+ peers) | 4+ vCPU | 4+ GB | 1 Gbps | 50+ GB |

Storage is only significant for pinning nodes. Relay-only nodes have minimal storage needs.

### 3.8 Backup and Recovery

**Relay nodes are stateless.** They generate a new peer ID on each start. This means:
- No data to back up on relay nodes
- Clients must be updated with new peer IDs if a relay is recreated
- For stable peer IDs, persist the libp2p private key and restore it on restart

**Pinning nodes are stateful.** Back up:
- The IDB blockstore/datastore (or underlying storage)
- The node's private key for consistent identity

---

## 4. Public Alternatives

### 4.1 STUN Servers

Public STUN servers provide NAT type detection and public address discovery at no cost. They handle only the signaling phase, not actual data traffic.

| Provider | Address | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Google | `stun:stun.l.google.com:19302` | Most widely used |
| Google (backup) | `stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302` | Secondary |
| Twilio | `stun:global.stun.twilio.com:3478` | |
| Mozilla | `stun:stun.services.mozilla.com:3478` | |

These are used by the browser's WebRTC stack automatically. libp2p's `@libp2p/webrtc` uses the browser's defaults.

### 4.2 TURN Servers

TURN servers relay actual data traffic, so they are not available for free at scale. Options:

| Provider | Type | Pricing |
|----------|------|---------|
| [coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn) | Self-hosted (open source) | Free (your infrastructure) |
| [Twilio Network Traversal](https://www.twilio.com/stun-turn) | Hosted | Pay per GB |
| [Xirsys](https://xirsys.com/) | Hosted | Free tier + paid plans |
| [Metered](https://www.metered.ca/stun-turn) | Hosted | Free tier (500 MB/month) |

### 4.3 IPFS Pinning Services

For persistent data storage without running your own pinning node:

| Provider | Free Tier | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) | 500 MB | Popular, REST API |
| [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/) | 5 GB | Built on Filecoin |
| [Infura IPFS](https://infura.io/) | 5 GB | Ethereum-focused |
| [Filebase](https://filebase.com/) | 5 GB | S3-compatible API |

**Note:** These services pin standard IPFS content. SwarmDB's CRDT data stored as IPFS blocks can be pinned by any IPFS-compatible pinning service, but the pinning service cannot interpret the CRDT semantics. Running a `CollabswarmNode` as your pinning node gives you CRDT-aware pinning (automatic subscription and pin on document publish).

### 4.4 Cost Considerations

| Component | Self-Hosted Cost | Hosted/Public Cost |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Bootstrap/Relay | $5-20/month (small VPS) | N/A (must self-host) |
| STUN | Free (use public) | Free |
| TURN | $10-50/month (VPS + bandwidth) | $0.40-1.00 per GB relayed |
| Pinning | $5-20/month (storage VPS) | Free tier usually sufficient for dev |

**Key takeaway:** The minimum cost for a production SwarmDB deployment is a single VPS ($5-10/month) running the relay server, plus free public STUN servers. Costs scale primarily with bandwidth (relay traffic) and storage (pinned data).

## 5. Docker Deployment Configs

Ready-to-use Docker configurations are provided in `guides/docker/`.

### 5.1 Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docker-compose.single.yaml` | All-in-one single server deployment |
| `docker-compose.production.yaml` | Production multi-relay deployment |
| `Dockerfile.relay` | Circuit relay / bootstrap node |
| `Dockerfile.bootstrap` | DHT bootstrap node (for large deployments) |

### 5.2 Single-Server Deployment

```bash
# Start the relay server
docker compose -f guides/docker/docker-compose.single.yaml up -d

# View relay connection info
docker compose -f guides/docker/docker-compose.single.yaml exec relay cat /shared/relay-info.json

# View logs
docker compose -f guides/docker/docker-compose.single.yaml logs -f relay

# Stop
docker compose -f guides/docker/docker-compose.single.yaml down
```

### 5.3 Production Deployment

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose -f guides/docker/docker-compose.production.yaml up -d

# Monitor health
docker compose -f guides/docker/docker-compose.production.yaml ps
```

> **Scaling:** The production compose file defines individually named relay services
> (`relay-1`, `relay-2`) rather than a single scalable `relay` service, because each
> relay node needs unique port mappings and may run on separate hosts. To add more
> relay nodes, duplicate a `relay-N` service block in the compose file with
> appropriate port offsets.

See individual Dockerfile documentation in `guides/docker/` for build instructions.

## 6. Troubleshooting

### 6.1 Common Connectivity Issues

#### "Cannot connect to relay"

**Symptoms:** Browser shows "error-no-relay" or connection timeout.

**Causes and solutions:**
1. **Relay not running:** Check `docker compose ps` and `docker compose logs relay`
2. **Wrong multiaddress:** Verify the peer ID and IP in the client config match the relay's output
3. **Port blocked:** Ensure port 9001 is open in firewall/security group
4. **TLS required:** Browsers require `wss://` for non-localhost connections. Set up a reverse proxy with TLS (see Section 2.6)
5. **CORS issues:** Not applicable to WebSocket connections, but if serving config.json, ensure CORS headers are set

#### "Peers connect but messages don't sync"

**Symptoms:** Peers appear connected but GossipSub messages are not received.

**Causes and solutions:**
1. **Relay not forwarding:** Ensure the relay has `floodPublish: true` and `canRelayMessage: true` in GossipSub config
2. **Topic mismatch:** Verify both peers subscribe to the same topic (e.g., `/document/<id>`)
3. **Mesh not formed:** GossipSub mesh takes 5-10 seconds to form. Wait or send warmup messages
4. **libp2p version mismatch:** gossipsub v14.x only works with libp2p v2.x. Verify that your `@chainsafe/libp2p-gossipsub` and `libp2p` versions are compatible by checking their release notes or the official libp2p documentation.

#### "WebRTC connection fails"

**Symptoms:** Peers connect via relay but never upgrade to direct WebRTC.

**Causes and solutions:**
1. **Symmetric NAT on both sides:** Direct WebRTC is impossible. The relay connection is the final path. Consider adding a TURN server
2. **STUN failure:** Check browser console for ICE candidate errors. Try a different STUN server
3. **Firewall blocking UDP:** WebRTC uses UDP. Corporate firewalls may block it. Circuit relay (TCP-based) is the fallback

### 6.2 Debugging Peer Discovery

Enable verbose logging to trace peer discovery:

```bash
# On the relay server
DEBUG=libp2p:* node dist/index.js

# In the browser app
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'libp2p:*')
```

**What to check:**
1. `libp2p:identify` — Verify the identify protocol completes between peers
2. `libp2p:gossipsub` — Check that peers join the mesh and exchange messages
3. `libp2p:circuit-relay-v2` — Verify relay reservations are established

### 6.3 Verifying the Relay is Working

1. **Check relay startup output:**
   ```text
   PeerId: 12D3KooW...
   Multiaddrs: [ '/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9001/ws/p2p/12D3KooW...' ]
   Subscribed to topics: swarmdb._peer-discovery._p2p._pubsub /swarmdb/integration-test/sync
   ```

2. **Check relay-info.json:**
   ```bash
   cat relay-info.json
   # Should contain: { "peerId": "...", "multiaddrs": [...], "wsMultiaddr": "..." }
   ```

3. **Test WebSocket connectivity:**
   ```bash
   # From another machine, test that the WebSocket port is open
   nc -zv <RELAY_IP> 9001
   ```

4. **Use the integration test app:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.integration.yaml up -d
   # Open http://localhost:3001 and http://localhost:3002 in two browsers
   # Both should show "connected-to-relay" status and discover each other
   ```

### 6.4 Firewall and NAT Configuration

**Minimum ports to open on the relay server:**

| Port | Protocol | Direction | Purpose |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 9001 | TCP | Inbound | WebSocket connections from browsers |
| 9002 | TCP | Inbound | TCP connections from other nodes |

**For browsers behind corporate firewalls:**
- Ensure outbound TCP to port 9001 (or 443 if using TLS) is allowed
- Ensure outbound UDP to STUN server port (19302 for Google) is allowed
- If UDP is blocked entirely, WebRTC will not work. Circuit Relay (TCP-based) will be the only transport

**Cloud provider security groups:**
- AWS: Add inbound rules for TCP 9001 and 9002
- GCP: Add firewall rules for tcp:9001 and tcp:9002
- Azure: Add NSG rules for TCP 9001 and 9002
- DigitalOcean: Configure cloud firewall for TCP 9001 and 9002

### 6.5 Performance Tuning

**Relay server:**
- Increase `ulimit -n` (file descriptor limit) for many concurrent connections: `ulimit -n 65535`
- Set `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096` for large deployments
- Monitor event loop lag; high lag indicates the relay is overloaded

**GossipSub tuning (relay-server/src/index.ts):**
```typescript
gossipsub({
  allowPublishToZeroTopicPeers: true,
  canRelayMessage: true,
  floodPublish: true,        // Ensures messages reach all peers (important for relay)
  // For large deployments, consider:
  // D: 6,                   // Target mesh degree (default 6)
  // Dlo: 4,                 // Low watermark (default 4)
  // Dhi: 12,                // High watermark (default 12)
  // heartbeatInterval: 700, // Heartbeat interval in ms (default 1000)
})
```

**Client-side tuning:**
```typescript
circuitRelayTransport({
  reservationConcurrency: 1,  // Number of concurrent relay reservations
  // Increase for better redundancy:
  // reservationConcurrency: 3,
})
```
