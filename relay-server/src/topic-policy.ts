/**
 * Pure topic auto-subscribe policy.
 *
 * The relay watches GossipSub `subscription-change` events: when a browser
 * peer subscribes to a new topic, the relay decides whether to also
 * subscribe so it can forward messages between peers that haven't yet
 * formed a direct WebRTC mesh.
 *
 * This module exposes the decision as a pure function so it can be unit-
 * tested without spinning up libp2p. The caller (index.ts) holds the live
 * state (the tracked-topics Set) and invokes this on each event.

 * Input to the auto-subscribe decision.

 * - `allowlist`: list of allowed topic prefixes, or null for open mode.
 *   When set, a topic must start with at least one prefix to be eligible.
 * - `maxAutoTopics`: hard cap on auto-subscribed topics. Once reached,
 *   further subscriptions are rejected.
 * - `autoTopicCount`: number of topics currently auto-subscribed (used
 *   against the cap). Tracked topics that are already subscribed return
 *   `AlreadyTracked` and don't increment the count.
 * - `isTracked`: predicate that returns true if the relay already tracks
 *   the topic (seed, EXTRA_TOPICS, or previously auto-subscribed).
 * - `systemTopicPrefixes`: prefixes that mark a topic as internal /
 *   system. Defaults to `SYSTEM_TOPIC_PREFIXES` from `config.ts`. Override
 *   for testing or stricter deployments.
