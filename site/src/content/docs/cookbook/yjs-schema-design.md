title: Designing Yjs schemas
description: Choose Yjs shared types and migration patterns for Swarmbase documents.
---

**Status: Illustrative schema patterns, not a complete application.** Yjs adapter behavior has focused tests, but these patterns do not prove multi-peer application convergence, persistence, or migration safety. See [CRDTs](../../concepts/crdts/) and [Limitations](../../concepts/limitations/).

## Choose merge behavior explicitly

| Data | Shared type | Merge behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Independent record fields | `Y.Map` | Same-key writes resolve by Yjs conflict rules; different keys survive |
| Ordered items | `Y.Array` | Concurrent inserts are retained in deterministic order |
| Collaborative prose | `Y.Text` | Character/operation-level merge |
| Editor trees | `Y.XmlFragment` / `Y.XmlElement` | Shared tree operations |
| Set-like membership | `Y.Map<boolean>` | Application interprets present/true keys as members |
| Counter | `Y.Map<number>` keyed by stable replica ID | Each replica owns one component; sum on read |

Do not treat plain objects stored inside shared types as recursively collaborative. Use nested shared types when fields require independent mutation.

## Mutate through Swarmbase

All mutations, initialization, and migrations must run inside and await `swarmDoc.change`. A bare `Y.Doc` mutation is not automatically authorized, encrypted, stored, or published by Swarmbase.

```ts
await swarmDoc.change((doc: Y.Doc) => {
  const tasks = doc.getArray<Y.Map<unknown>>('tasks');
  const task = new Y.Map<unknown>();
  task.set('id', crypto.randomUUID());
  task.set('title', 'Review schema');
  task.set('status', 'todo');
  tasks.push([task]);
});
```

Use `doc.transact` inside that callback when several Yjs operations should emit one Yjs transaction:

```ts
await swarmDoc.change((doc: Y.Doc) => {
  doc.transact(() => {
    doc.getMap('meta').set('updatedAt', Date.now());
    doc.getText('body').insert(0, 'Imported text');
  });
});
```

A Yjs transaction does not make network publication transactional, does not span Swarmbase documents, and does not roll back an in-place Yjs mutation if later asynchronous storage/publication fails.

## IDs, lists, and counters

Reference list entries by stable IDs, never array indexes. Reordering by delete/reinsert can duplicate an item under concurrency; for frequently sorted collections, consider a map keyed by ID plus an application-defined sortable key.

For a distributed counter, persist one random `replicaId` per application replica/device. Do not use a transient libp2p peer ID or a newly generated value per increment:

```ts
await swarmDoc.change((doc: Y.Doc) => {
  const counts = doc.getMap<number>('votesByReplica');
  counts.set(replicaId, (counts.get(replicaId) ?? 0) + 1);
});
```

This avoids same-key increment races between distinct replicas, but concurrent sessions incorrectly sharing one replica ID can still overwrite one another.

## Migrations

Run migrations through the same awaited change boundary:

```ts
await swarmDoc.change((doc: Y.Doc) => {
  const meta = doc.getMap<unknown>('meta');
  const version = (meta.get('schemaVersion') as number | undefined) ?? 1;

  if (version < 2) {
    for (const task of doc.getArray<Y.Map<unknown>>('tasks').toArray()) {
      if (!task.has('priority')) task.set('priority', 'medium');
    }
    meta.set('schemaVersion', 2);
  }
});
```

Guards such as `has()` make repeated execution locally idempotent for that operation. They do not prove that arbitrary concurrent migrations commute: two versions can write incompatible values or observe different intermediate states. Prefer additive fields, tolerate unknown/newer fields, never reuse a field name with a different type, and test old/new peers concurrently.

## Heuristics, not limits

- Split documents at access-control, lazy-loading, ownership, and recovery boundaries.
- Document size targets such as 1 MB and nesting guidance such as two or three levels are application heuristics, not Swarmbase or Yjs limits.
- Deep structures, large histories, and high update rates require measurement with realistic peers and storage.
- One Swarmbase document has one ACL/key domain; separately shared data belongs in separate documents.

Yjs garbage collection can remove some deleted structs when safe in the local state, but GC changes history/update assumptions and does not mean every document or encoded history only shrinks. Retained updates, snapshots, peers with older state vectors, repeated writes, and Swarmbase's own change/block history all affect storage. Do not promise that tombstones are always permanent or that GC provides application-level deletion. See [Storage](../../concepts/storage/).
