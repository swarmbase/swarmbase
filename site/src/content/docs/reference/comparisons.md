description: How Swarmbase compares to other local-first, CRDT, and realtime collaboration tools.
---

Swarmbase occupies a specific niche: **encrypted, peer-to-peer CRDT document collaboration with source-available libraries**. This page compares it to related projects to help you understand when Swarmbase is the right choice.

## Swarmbase vs Yjs (standalone)

[Yjs](https://docs.yjs.dev) is a high-performance CRDT library for shared editing. It provides shared types (`Y.Map`, `Y.Array`, `Y.Text`) and network-agnostic sync, but leaves encryption, authentication, access control, storage, and peer discovery to the application.

| | Swarmbase | Yjs (standalone) |
|---|---|---|
| **CRDT** | Adapts Yjs or Automerge | Built-in CRDT runtime |
| **Encryption** | AES-GCM by default, BeeKEM key sharing | Application responsibility |
| **Authentication** | ECDSA P-384 signing (optional; can be disabled with `enableSigning: false`); UCAN helpers exist but are not integrated into the document change path | Application responsibility |
| **Access control** | Reader/writer ACL with cryptographic enforcement | Application responsibility |
| **Storage** | Helia/IPFS (IndexedDB in browser) | Application responsibility (y-indexeddb plugin) |
| **Networking** | libp2p (WebSocket, WebRTC, WebTransport, GossipSub) | y-websocket, y-webrtc providers |
| **Peer discovery** | Bootstrap, Kademlia DHT, AutoNAT | Application responsibility |

Swarmbase is a good choice when you need encryption, signing, and access control out of the box. Use Yjs standalone when you already have your own auth, transport, and encryption layers.

## Swarmbase vs Automerge (standalone)

[Automerge](https://automerge.org) is a CRDT library with a JSON-like document model. Like Yjs, it provides merge semantics but not encryption, access control, or networking.

| | Swarmbase | Automerge (standalone) |
|---|---|---|
| **Data model** | Adapts Automerge or Yjs | JSON-like CRDT documents |
| **Sync transport** | libp2p + GossipSub | Automerge-repo (WebSocket, HTTP) |
| **Encryption at rest** | AES-GCM per document | Application responsibility |
| **Key exchange** | BeeKEM for dynamic groups | Application responsibility |
| **Rich text** | Via Yjs adapter | Via Automerge Text type |

Swarmbase wraps Automerge documents with encryption and access control. If you only need the CRDT merge semantics, use Automerge directly.

## Swarmbase vs Liveblocks

[Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io) is a managed realtime collaboration platform. It provides presence, comments, notifications, and CRDT-based storage as a hosted service.

| | Swarmbase | Liveblocks |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Peer-to-peer with relay infrastructure | Client-server (Liveblocks backend) |
| **Deployment** | Self-hosted (you run relays) | Managed service (Liveblocks cloud) |
| **Data sovereignty** | Full control (encrypted on your infrastructure) | Data stored on Liveblocks servers |
| **Encryption model** | End-to-end (server never sees plaintext) | Encrypted in transit (server sees data) |
| **Offline first** | Yes (IndexedDB local replica) | Experimental (Yjs + IndexedDB; available after initial load) |
| **Pricing** | Open source (MIT) | Free tier + paid plans |
| **Production readiness** | Alpha (not production-ready) | Production-grade |
| **AI collaboration features** | Not included | AI comments, AI copilots |

Use Liveblocks for production collaborative UIs with presence, comments, and rich-text when you are comfortable with a managed service. Use Swarmbase when you need end-to-end encryption and data sovereignty, or when you want to own your infrastructure.

## Swarmbase vs RxDB

[RxDB](https://rxdb.info) is a local-first NoSQL database for JavaScript. It stores JSON documents locally, provides reactive queries (RxJS observables), and syncs with backend servers via replication plugins.

| | Swarmbase | RxDB |
|---|---|---|
| **Data model** | CRDT documents (Yjs/Automerge) | JSON documents with schemas |
| **Query language** | IndexManager (full-text + blind indexes) | Mango/MongoDB query syntax |
| **Sync model** | Peer-to-peer (libp2p) | Client-server replication |
| **Backend** | Relay nodes (stateless) | RxServer, CouchDB, GraphQL, Firebase, Supabase, etc. |
| **Encryption** | End-to-end (AES-GCM per document) | Field-level encryption plugin |
| **Convergence** | CRDT (Yjs/Automerge) | CRDT plugin + conflict handlers |
| **Framework support** | React, Redux | React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, Expo |
| **Production readiness** | Alpha | Production-grade (v17+) |

RxDB is a mature, production-ready local-first database with broad backend support. Swarmbase is focused on encrypted peer-to-peer CRDT collaboration without a central server. They solve different problems.

## Swarmbase vs Jazz

[Jazz](https://jazz.tools) is a local-first relational database with row-level permissions and real-time sync. It provides a managed sync server and a React-friendly API.

| | Swarmbase | Jazz |
|---|---|---|
| **Data model** | CRDT documents | Relational tables with schemas |
| **Sync model** | Peer-to-peer (libp2p) | Client-server (Jazz Cloud or self-hosted) |
| **Permissions** | Cryptographic ACL (reader/writer keys) | Row-level permissions |
| **Encryption** | End-to-end (server never sees data) | E2E encryption |
| **Server** | Relay nodes (pass-through) | Jazz sync server (stateful) |
| **Framework support** | React, Redux | React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Expo |
| **Production readiness** | Alpha | Production (Jazz Cloud) |

Jazz provides a more polished developer experience with managed infrastructure. Swarmbase gives you more control over networking and infrastructure, at the cost of more setup.

## Swarmbase vs ElectricSQL

[ElectricSQL](https://electric-sql.com) syncs a subset of Postgres to local clients. It provides read-path sync from a Postgres database to client-side PGlite instances.

| | Swarmbase | ElectricSQL |
|---|---|---|
| **Sync direction** | Bidirectional (peers read and write) | Primarily read-path sync (writes go through your API) |
| **Source of truth** | CRDT merge (no central authority) | Postgres (server is authoritative) |
| **Data model** | CRDT documents | Postgres tables with Shapes |
| **Schema** | Schema-less (CRDT types) | Postgres DDL |
| **Encryption** | End-to-end | Server-side (you control Postgres access) |
| **Offline** | Yes (IndexedDB local replica) | Yes (PGlite local replica) |
| **Production readiness** | Alpha | Postgres sync is stable |

ElectricSQL is ideal when you already have a Postgres database and want to sync a subset of it to clients. Swarmbase is designed for peer-to-peer document collaboration where there is no central database.

## When to choose Swarmbase

Swarmbase stands out when you need:

1. **End-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer documents** — no server ever sees plaintext
2. **No central database server** — your application has no backend database at all
3. **Full control over infrastructure** — you run the relay nodes, you hold the keys
4. **Composable libraries** — use only the packages you need, not a monolithic platform
5. **Source-available transparency** — every layer is inspectable and modifiable

If any of the projects above matches your requirements more closely, use it — they are more mature and have larger communities. Swarmbase is an alpha project exploring a specific design point: encrypted CRDT documents that sync directly between peers, with no server in the data path.
